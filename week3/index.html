            <h1>This, Objects, DOM, and Events</h1>
            <h2>This</h2>
            <p>
                How did I not know "THIS" existed.  How much easier does this make things!  I can reference the master object when creating a function as a part the object with this
                 shorthand.  After all the Javascript I've learned why am I just now hearing about "This!"  Though it is important to note that it doesn't work in arrow functions

            <h2>Objectification</h2>
            <p>
                Objects are containers that store things, in the form of constants, variables, methods, arrays, and all sorts of great things can be placed into objects.  
                Nearly anything can be made into an object which can then be named and referenced and the properties you give that object can be referenced.  A good thing to 
                know is that new properties can be added at any time to an object by referencing the new property name and setting it equal to something.
            </p>
            <h2>The DOM Document Object Model</h2>
            <p>
                This is a understood object that represents the HTML document that that script is loaded into, or a part of.  It is represented by a network of connected nodes 
                that form a tree like structure.  Everything (From the tags to their properties) on the page is a part of that tree, in an ever building network of parent and child nodes.
            </p>
            <h2>Events!</h2>
            <p>Events are where the fun happen.  An event is basicaly when something happens.  You can set the type of event you are looking for and create a node to even listen for that event 
                though this can also be done in the html document if you want.  Such as setting the onBlur or onClick for a text field, so that things happen.  This works quite well as a way
                to validate entries in a form before the user gets too for example setting an onBlur to listen for changing off the credit card field to run a quick validation of the card number
                or the like.  One can add event listeners using JS just as well as HTML.
