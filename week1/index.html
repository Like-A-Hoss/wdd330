            <h2>Introduction to my notes</h2>
            <p>Hello Stress my old friend.  I've come to live with you again.  It took me till Friday to get my book key!  Fortunately this weeks readings
                did not require it.  So I managed to luck out on that end.  After reviewing my course expecations I discovered that they expect me to report
                on my readings and work by using VS Code as a sort of note pad.  this will be a bit annoying but what ever.  I can adapt and move on.  </p>
            <p>
                Either way it's been a while sice I have worked in Javascript this in depth and doing this while studying Web Backend and Database design and 
                development, and intro to database all at once is going to be fun.
            </p>
            <h2>The Reading</h2>
                <p>
                    The author of this book is very fasinated with the early HTML Cowboys blazing a trail and coming up with various tags.  Followed along with project.
