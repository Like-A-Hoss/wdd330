            <h1>Week 10 Notes</h1>
            <h2>
                Form Validation
            </h2>
            <p>
                Form Validation is something I covered a few weeks ago in Back End development and while it is possible to bypass in front end that doesn't mean 
                that one should ignore it.  Front end validation is a front line way to make sure things are working before you pass things to the back end for the final lines
                to look at it.  HTML 5 properties on form elements can be used for verifiaction and even check a password is valid, and mark a input as required.
            </p><p>
                Though JS can also be used and it can provide additional feedback as to what one needs to do to pass and even do things like unlock more fields, or my personal 
                favorite unlock the submit button.  They can't submit bad data, if they can't hit submit.  Of course users can disable Javascript.  Which is annoying.<img src="img/submit_meme.jpg" alt="good idea meme" >

            <h2>Fetch() Boy </h2>
            <p>
                Updated alternative to older AJAX method.  Won't crash out on a 404 or 500 response making it more stable.  Fetch has a credentials option that when set to 
                include allows cross - origin cookie request. </p> 
            <p> example code: <br>
                <textarea>fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
                    .then(response => response.json())
                    .then(data => console.log(data));</textarea>
            </p>
