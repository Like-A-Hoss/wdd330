            <h1>Week 4 of Forms and Objects</h1>
            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <p>
                Forms are commonly associated with back end data processing but Validation of data 
                can be done front end.  This is very useful and an example of it can be seen <a href="/week4/week11/assign11.html">here</a>.  This is a project
                from my web engineering course that makes use of both php and javascript.  I have a feeling you may not find it fully functional as the 
                git-pages do not seem to be able to use server side languages, from what I've seen.  Either way.  The page will validate information with javaScript, 
                such as credit cards, then forward this informaiton on.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>click <a href="/week4/search.html">here</a> for sample.</p>
            <p>
                Aria is a set of guidelines for development that are intended to make a page compatable with the viually impaired, and their page readers.  I am current
                learning about this in CSE340 Backend development.
