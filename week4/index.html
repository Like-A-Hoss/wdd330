            <h1>Week 4 of Forms and Objects</h1>
            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <p>
                Forms are commonly associated with back end data processing but Validation of data 
                can be done front end.  This is very useful and an example of it can be seen <a href="/wdd330/week4/week11/assign11.html">here</a>.  This is a project
                from my web engineering course that makes use of both php and javascript.  I have a feeling you may not find it fully functional as the 
                git-pages do not seem to be able to use server side languages, from what I've seen.  Either way.  The page will validate information with javaScript, 
                such as credit cards, then forward this informaiton on.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>click <a href="/wdd330//week4/search.html">here</a> for sample.</p>

                Aria is a set of guidelines for development that are intended to make a page compatable with the viually impaired, and their page readers.  I am current
                learning about this in CSE340 Backend development.

            <h2>Object Oriented Familarity</h2>
            <p>
                After getting my Programming certification I laugh seeing this.  Because here is something I know 
                quite well my old friend Object Oriented Programing.  A good old friend from my days of writting apps
                 in Java and Python programs.  So let's do a quick run down of some Vocabularity!
                 <ul>
                     <li><b>Object Oriented Programing -</b> A programing method that uses "objects" that model reworld objects, including 
                         living beings.  A cat can be modled as an object, in a program for example.</li>
                    <li><b>Encapsulation -</b> A property of object oriented programing.  All objects contain or encapsulate 
                    and protect their contents from interfearance by things outside them.  Similar to how skin protects the innards 
                    of living critters, and keeps everything inside.  </li>
                    <li><b>Polymorphism -</b> Aside from proof that at least the early object oriented programmers were 
                    nerds, Polymorphism is the concept of taking something and turning it into something else similar to the 
                    Dungeons and Dragons spell by that name, which takes one living critter and turns it into another, though another 
                    comparison comes from adaptation in living creatures.  Polymorphism can also be compaired to how pigeons in New York 
                    can differe from Pigeons in Tokyo.  Both are still pigeons, but they have been apated to new tasks.</li>
                    <li><b>Inheritance -</b> Taking someone and adding new features to it to make it soemthing new.  In comparison to that cat, it 
                    the process that takes a lizard, and though a series of inheritances keeping features and adding and polymorphing others
                    we eventually get a cat.</li>
                 </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Protyping</h3>
                <p>
                    The idea of a prototype call is it creates a base  for which all classes or objects made 
                    from the prototype can be modified or built upon.  
                </p>
            </p>
            <h2>Scrum Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>What did I do since the last meeting?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Assisted Team mate with issues
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>What am I going to do next?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Review how many classes have final projects.  Consider mixing all final project that uses back end development, front end development and database development into one and submit 1 project to better maximise time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>What are my Blockers?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                       had to work extra hours this week. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        still no stress releif
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        may have spent too much/not enough time on my print farm.
