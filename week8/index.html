            <h2>Reading Notes</h2>
            <h3>Henshin, Transform!</h3>
            <img src="../week8/img/transform.gif" alt="Power Ranger Transforms" />
            <p>
                Transform is a css feature that lets one to mess with objects on the screen allowing them to
                be roated, scaled, skewed, or modified in one of many interesting visual ways.  
            </p>
            <P>
                Translation allows for moving objects around the viewing area.  This can be done realatively or 
                more percisely with pixle measurements.  Also all of these transoformations, it might be a good idea to include
                a compatibleilty clause to allow them to work with older browers like older IOS Safari, Older Droid.
            </P>
            <p>
                The Scale function can be used realative (1) being the same (2) being double and (0.5) being half.
                it can also be fead very specfic X and & numbers.  Using realiave is just easiest
            </p>
            <p>
                Rotate is a useful function in that it can shift the orientation of text allowing greater 
                emphisis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Skew allows for a slant between X and Y Axis
            </p>
            <h3>Transitions</h3>
            <p>
                The start of CSS based animation, it is worth noting that animation by this method takes
                less system resources and this renders better on older or mobile devices.
            </p>
            <P>Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:<ul>
            <li>    Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
            <li>    Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.                </li>
            <li>    Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Weâ€™ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
            </P>
            </ul>
            <h2>Scrum Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>What did I do since the last meeting?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
                <li>What am I going to do next?</li>
                <ul>
