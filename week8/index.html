            <h1>Week 8, this late Already?</h1>
            <h2>Reading Notes</h2>
            <h3>Henshin, Transform!</h3>
            <img src="../week8/img/transform.gif" alt="Power Ranger Transforms" />
            <p>
                Transform is a css feature that lets one to mess with objects on the screen allowing them to
                be roated, scaled, skewed, or modified in one of many interesting visual ways.  
            </p>
            <P>
                Translation allows for moving objects around the viewing area.  This can be done realatively or 
                more percisely with pixle measurements.  Also all of these transoformations, it might be a good idea to include
                a compatibleilty clause to allow them to work with older browers like older IOS Safari, Older Droid.
            </P>
            <p>
                The Scale function can be used realative (1) being the same (2) being double and (0.5) being half.
                it can also be fead very specfic X and & numbers.  Using realiave is just easiest
            </p>
            <p>
                Rotate is a useful function in that it can shift the orientation of text allowing greater 
                emphisis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Skew allows for a slant between X and Y Axis
            </p>
            <h3>Transitions</h3>
            <p>
                The start of CSS based animation, it is worth noting that animation by this method takes
                less system resources and this renders better on older or mobile devices.
            </p>
            <P>Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:<ul>
            <li>    Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
            <li>    Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.                </li>
            <li>    Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Weâ€™ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
            
            </ul></P>
            <h3>Animation</h3>
            <P>
                CSS based animation uses keyframes similar to Flash.  This is great for mobile devices that 
                as they do not have as weighty of CPU's as laptop or desktop devices.  With the drive to ensure
             a uniform experiance across all platforms this is helpful.  Also bypasses the lack of Flash, and 
             the fact that IOS devices did not support flash.  
            </P>
            <h2>
                Canvas, SVG, DRAG and Drop
            </h2>
            <h3>Canvas</h3>
            <p>
                Canvas is an art API, it was originaly developed by Apple and has GREAT backwards compatibleilty.  
                It is a standard that has been adpoted into HTML5.
            </p>
            <P>
                One should start with an open and close canvas tag and a message between that is the error message 
                for in case Canvas does not work.
            </P>
