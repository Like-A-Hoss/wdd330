            <h1>DOM, Window Object, and Global Constants/Varibles</h1>
            <h2>The Window</h2><p>
                The window is a global object that exists solely in the context of browers.  Thus for 
                other applications like a discord chatbot, toasters, micowaves, and anything that is 
                cellphone apps, or doing anything that is not a application to be run in a web browser 
                do not act as if this exists.
            </p><P>
                Global varibles for we development are placed here. global varibles are declared without 
                using const, let, var ect.  Just something like x=7  they can be retrieved like this 
                window.x 
            </P><P>
                parseInt() and isNaN() are also a part of the window object.  isNaN is likely good for 
                error trapping.  Best to keep that one in mind.
            </P>
            <h2>Dialogs</h2>
            <p>
                dialog boxes are also a part of the window object so alert(), confirm() and prompt() are 
                all children of the window.  
            </p><p>
                It might be well worth noting that some of these stop everything else from running like 
                confirm().  
            </p>
            <h2>Browser Info</h2>
            <p>Should you need it you can even get the informaiton aobut the client's browser.  This can 
                be useful for allowing you the developer to ensure backwords compatiblility with older browsers.
            </p>
            <h1>Html5 API's</h1>
            <h2>Data Attribute</h2>
            <p>
                the Data attribute is a good way of inserting data into a page, with the intent for it to be 
                used by a JS program.  
            </p>
            <h2>Scrum Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>What did I do since the last meeting?</li>
