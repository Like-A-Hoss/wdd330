                A Little Bit of Review 
            </h1>
            <h2>Chapter 2 - Programming Basics </h2>
            <p>
                This felt like a repeat of CS111 - JavaScript.  I think by now I know this stuff still I skimmed it, rather than skip to the project.  Of the content presented 
                I did not feel much of it was new just some brushes with things I used to know, and having them be brought back to the front of my mind.  The flow of information 
                though was a helpful review.  Reminders of how JavaScript treats strings like arrays is helpful.  I will not be doing the code experiment they pose in the book 
                as they presented it.  Because mostly...I don't want that message poping up on every page that loads that is poor UX.

                Chapter 3 - Arrays and Loops
            </h2>
            <P>
                Arrays and sets are things we are already playing in this class.  But that is alright because they are a good idea.  Another quick review, skipped to the summary 
                and then the project for this chapter.  I'm bookmarking this one, sometimes it's just as important to know where to find information as it is to know it yourself.  Once again lets run a button on this.
